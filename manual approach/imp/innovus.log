The in-memory database contained RC information but was not saved. To save 
the RC information, use saveDesign's -rc option. Note: Saving RC information can be quite large, 
so it should only be saved when it is really desired.
Design is saved in OA mode instead of non-OA mode with library name as 'FEOADesignlib'. Upgrading is done because RefLibs are available and Lef files are not present.
